Basic memory game developed during the _nology course using HTML, SCSS/CSS and JavaScript

Requirements:

- Must be linked to the relevant section of your portfolio
- Must be nicely styled and responsive with the page (simple is best!)
- Must have at least 15 Git commits for the project and repo on GitHub
- JS code must be formatted as functions!
- Must use click or keypress events in JavaScript to trigger the events 
  in the game. (No refreshing to start the game again!!)
  
How to play:
  
Click on individual cards to flip and reveal the mascot. 
If you are unable to find a matching pair a pop-up will tell you to try again and the cards will flip back down.
Once you reveal the same mascot twice within the two attempts those cards will turn blank. When you match all the mascots the game is done. 

It's harder than it looks!

Click on the 'Play Again?' button to refresh and randomise the cards on the board.
